i have a postgres database with the following tables: media_output and media_copies media_programs and media_types.
the table media_output has the following columns:
media_id (which is the primary key), title, media_date, author, media_link.
the table media_copies has id, media_id (related to media_id in media_output table), link which is a url
the media_programs has id, media_id (related to media_id in media_output table), media_program (which is a shorttext of size 200)
the media_types table has type_id (unique id) media_id (related to media_id in media_output table) and media_type (text) columns

and i have an excel table having the following columns:
Title, Date, URL, Categories, Tags, Programs, lims_post_copies, lims_copies_count, Author Username
i want a python code that imports the excel table to the database, using the following constraints:
Title column in excel goes to title column in media_output table.
Date column in excel goes to date column in media_output table, but the time must be removed, keep only the date.
URL column in excel must go to media_link column in media_output table.
for the Categories column in excel, the cell contains multiple information, if it contains one the programs that can be found in the database table programs_list, column program_name, that program must be added as a row in media_programs table in the database with the correct media_id for this row in media_output table (all programs in that cell must be added)
this cell will be used also to fill the media_types table, by checking the types_list table, type_name column, all items found in table and in excel cells of column "categories" but be added as rows in media_types table with the appropriate media_id
the other columns in the excel can be disregarded

///////////////////////////////////////////////
import description
the categories column contain multiple categories separated by '|'.
the categories column must be divided to two: Output and Program according to the following:
i have two csv files: media_types.csv and media_programs.csv
in the media_types.csv there are two columns:
Category_name and Media_type, Category_name is the name found in the main csv
media-type is the name of the output that i want it to be saved
same for media_programs.csv
there's category_name and program_name columns

table to db
i have this code that imports a csv and display it as table according to some logic. i want to change that code in a way that it is imported to my postgres database. 
<?php
$page_title = "LIME Posts Import";
require_once('functions.php');
require_once('config.php');
include("header.php"); 

if (!$is_admin) {
  echo "Access denied.";
  exit;
}

// Load the media types and programs into associative arrays
$media_types = array();
$media_programs = array();
$types_file = fopen('media_types.csv', 'r');
$programs_file = fopen('media_programs.csv', 'r');

// Load media types
while (($data = fgetcsv($types_file)) !== false) {
    $category_name = $data[0];
    $media_type = $data[1];
    $media_types[$category_name] = $media_type;
}

// Load media programs
while (($data = fgetcsv($programs_file)) !== false) {
    $category_name = $data[0];
    $program_name = $data[1];
    $media_programs[$category_name] = $program_name;
}

fclose($types_file);
fclose($programs_file);
// Load the LIME posts CSV file
$file = fopen('export-2023-march.csv', 'r');
$header = fgetcsv($file);

$column_indices = array();

// Map the column names to their indices
foreach ($header as $i => $column_name) {
    $column_indices[$column_name] = $i;
}

echo "<table>";
echo "<tr>";
echo "<th>Title</th>";
echo "<th>Date</th>";
echo "<th>Permalink</th>";
echo "<th>Output</th>";
echo "<th>Program</th>";
echo "</tr>";

while (($data = fgetcsv($file)) !== false) {
    // Extract data using column names instead of indices
    $title = $data[$column_indices['Title']];
    $date = date('Y-m-d', strtotime($data[$column_indices['Date']]));
    $permalink = $data[$column_indices['Permalink']];
    $categories = $data[$column_indices['Categories']];

    // Split the categories by the '|' delimiter
    $category_list = explode('|', $categories);

    // Initialize the output and program names
    $output = "";
    $program = "";

    // Look up the media type and program for each category
    foreach ($category_list as $category) {
      if (isset($media_types[$category])) {
          if (!empty($output)) { // Check if $output is empty
              $output .= ', '; // Add a comma separator only if $output is not empty
          }
          $output .= $media_types[$category];
      }
      if (isset($media_programs[$category])) {
          if (!empty($program)) { // Check if $program is empty
              $program .= ', '; // Add a comma separator only if $program is not empty
          }
          $program .= $media_programs[$category];
      }
  }
    
    echo "<tr>";
    echo "<td>$title</td>";
    echo "<td>$date</td>";
    echo "<td>$permalink</td>";
    echo "<td>$output</td>";
    echo "<td>$program</td>";
    echo "</tr>";
}

echo "</table>";
fclose($file);
?>

i will give you the tables and relations in my database:
the database has the following tables: media_output and media_copies media_programs and media_types.
the table media_output has the following columns:
media_id (which is the primary key), title, media_date, author, media_link.
the table media_copies has id, media_id (related to media_id in media_output table), link which is a url
the media_programs has id, media_id (related to media_id in media_output table), program (which is a shorttext of size 200)
the media_types table has type_id (unique id) media_id (related to media_id in media_output table) and media_name (text) columns

so i need a code that checks the permalink of each row in the csv, and compare it with the link column in media_output. 
if the permalink exists, it means the record already exists, i only need to update it's values.
if the permalink doesn't exist, i need to create a new row in media_output.
the "Output" column in the table created in my code belongs to the media_types table found in the database.
each media_output row must have: title, permalink and date
each media_programs row must have one program that we found in programs column, so all programs must be added, each on a row
same for media_types table in the database, which is named "Output" in the html table created in my code.
can you help me with that code?

description for importing copies to db from the combined.xlsx file
i have a postgres database with the following tables: media_output and media_copies media_programs and media_types.
the table media_output has the following columns:
media_id (which is the primary key), title, media_date, author, media_link.
the table media_copies has id, media_id (related to media_id in media_output table), link which is a url
the media_programs has id, media_id (related to media_id in media_output table), media_program (which is a shorttext of size 200)
the media_types table has type_id (unique id) media_id (related to media_id in media_output table) and media_type (text) columns
now i want to import a csv to this database in this way:
the csv has many columns, but im interested in three columns (not case sensitive):
original_link: it contains a link that must be found in media_output table in the database.
copy_link: it contains links.
original_copy: can contain either "copy"or "original" (not case sensitive)

i want a php code that imports only the copies, not the original into media_copies table. to know which media_id you must compare the original_link column with the link column in media_output table in the tadabase
